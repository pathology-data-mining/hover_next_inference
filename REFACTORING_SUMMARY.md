# HoVer-NeXt Inference - Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to enhance the usability of the HoVer-NeXt inference pipeline.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Main Entry Point (`main.py`)
- Created `main.py` in the root directory for easy access
- Users can now run `python3 main.py [arguments]` as documented in README
- Properly configured path to work from the repository root without installation

### 2. Updated Documentation (`README.md`)
- **Fixed inconsistencies**: Changed `--output_root` to `--output_dir` throughout
- **Added Quick Start section**: Provides a simple 3-step guide to get started
- **Enhanced Setup section**: Added three installation options (Conda, pip, Docker)
- **Added Usage section**: Comprehensive documentation of all command-line arguments
- **Added examples**: Shows different usage patterns and methods to run the tool
- **Reference to example configs**: Points users to detailed examples

### 3. Improved Command-Line Interface (`src/inference/__main__.py`)
- **Better help messages**: More descriptive help text for all arguments
- **Examples in help**: Added usage examples directly in the help output
- **Input validation**: Added validation for required parameters and file paths
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Better feedback**: Improved console output with clear status messages
- **Fixed syntax warning**: Removed invalid escape sequence in line 201 (`", \ tune"` → `", tune"`)

### 4. Added Example Configurations (`example_config.sh`)
- 14 comprehensive examples covering:
  - Basic usage
  - Performance tuning
  - Batch processing
  - Model selection
  - Output options
  - Cluster/HPC usage
  - Different input types
  - Resolution-specific settings

### 5. Enhanced Package Metadata (`setup.py`)
- Added complete package metadata (authors, description, URLs)
- Added project URLs (bug tracker, documentation, source, publication)
- Added classifiers for PyPI
- Added keywords for discoverability
- Configured to read requirements from requirements.txt

### 6. Added Contributing Guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Clear instructions for setting up development environment
- Code style guidelines
- Testing instructions
- Pull request process
- Issue reporting guidelines

## Benefits for Users

### Easier to Get Started
- Clear Quick Start guide
- Main.py works out of the box
- Better error messages guide users when something goes wrong

### Better Documentation
- All arguments clearly documented
- Multiple examples for different use cases
- Consistent naming between code and documentation

### More Professional
- Proper package metadata
- Contributing guidelines for community involvement
- Better error handling and user feedback

### More Maintainable
- Clearer code organization
- Better separation of concerns
- Comprehensive examples for testing

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are **backward compatible**:
- Existing command-line arguments still work
- The package entry point (`hover-next-inference`) still works
- Python module execution (`python -m inference`) still works
- No breaking changes to the API

## Migration Guide

### For Users Currently Using the Old Documentation

The README previously used `--output_root` but the actual parameter name in the code was `--output_dir`. This has been fixed in the documentation.

If you were following the old README examples:
```bash
python3 main.py --output_root "results/"
```

You should now use the correct parameter name (which actually always was required):
```bash
python3 main.py --output_dir "results/"
```

Note: The code itself hasn't changed for this parameter - only the documentation has been corrected.

### For Users Installing as a Package

No changes needed! The package can still be installed and used the same way:
```bash
pip install -e .
hover-next-inference --help
```

## Testing

The changes have been validated to ensure:
- ✓ Python syntax is correct (no compilation errors)
- ✓ Imports work correctly
- ✓ Module structure is intact
- ✓ Help messages display properly
- ✓ Backward compatibility is maintained

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future enhancement:
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests with sample data
- Create a configuration file format (YAML/JSON)
- Add progress bars for long-running operations
- Implement logging system for debugging
- Add GPU memory usage monitoring
